## Restrictions

There are some restrictions for the integration because of the unique custom models of the Epic
Fight mod.

The Pose configuration is not supported for the Epic Fight models, and the NPC will always use the
Epic Fight pose.

Scaling is also not supported because of the unique model size of the Epic Fight mod.

Most of the other configuration options are supported and can be used with the Epic Fight models.

## Requirements

- [Easy NPC Mod][easy_npc] version 3.7.2 or higher
